**PGC** (Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping) introduces a refined method to adapt traditional gradient clipping. By focusing on pixel-wise gradient magnitudes, it retains vital texture details. This approach acts as a versatile **plug-in**, seamlessly complementing existing **SDS and LDM-based 3D generative models**. The result is a marked improvement in high-resolution 3D texture synthesis.

With PGC, users can:
- Address and mitigate gradient-related challenges common in LDM, elevating the quality of 3D generation.
- Employ the [**SDXL**](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models) approach, previously not adaptable for 3D generation.

## Results
Incorporating the proficient and potent **PGC** implementation into SDXL guidance has led to notable advancements in 3D generation results.

## Tips for SDXL
- Using [sdxl-vae-fp16-fix](https://huggingface.co/madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix)
- [Controlnet](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-depth-sdxl-1.0) may be important to make training easier to converge
